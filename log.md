# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Saturday, June 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I did the day 1 css challenge on 100DaysCss. The challenge is to create a custom build number with gradient.

**Thoughts** I've been coding for a few months. I thought I really grasped CSS but coming across this challenge, I realize I am still struggling with CSS. Still, I was able to complete the challenge with lots of research. I had some errors along the way but was able to resolve them all.

**Today's Progress**: I did the day 2 css challenge on 100DaysCss. The challenge is to create an animated menu button.

**Thoughts** I had a challenge positioning the menu button in the center of the circle, still this was super fun.
